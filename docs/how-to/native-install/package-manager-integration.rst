This section provides information about the required meta-packages for the
following AMD ROCm programming models:

- Heterogeneous-Computing Interface for Portability (HIP)
- OpenCL™
- OpenMP™

ROCm Package Naming Conventions
*******************************

A meta-package is a grouping of related packages and dependencies used to
support a specific use case.

**Example:** Running HIP applications

All meta-packages exist in both versioned and non-versioned forms.

- Non-versioned packages – For a single-version installation of the ROCm stack
- Versioned packages – For multi-version installations of the ROCm stack

    :alt: ROCm Release Package Naming

The figure above demonstrates the single and multi-version ROCm packages' naming
structure, including examples for various Linux distributions. See terms below:

*Module* - It is the part of the package that represents the name of the ROCm
component.

**Example:** The examples mentioned in the image represent the ROCm HIP module.

*Module version* - It is the version of the library released in that package. It
should increase with a newer release.

*Release version* - It shows the ROCm release version when the package was
released.

**Example:** `50400` points to the ROCm 5.4.0 release.

*Build id* - It represents the Jenkins build number for that release.

*Arch* - It shows the architecture for which the package was created.

*Distro* - It describes the distribution for which the package was created. It is
valid only for rpm packages.

**Example:** `el8` represents RHEL 8.x packages.

Components of ROCm Programming Models
*************************************

The figure below demonstrates the high-level layered architecture of ROCm programming models and their meta-packages.
All meta-packages are a combination of required packages and libraries.

**Example:**

- ``rocm-hip-runtime`` is used to deploy on supported machines to execute HIP
  applications.
- ``rocm-hip-sdk`` contains runtime components to deploy and execute HIP
  applications.

.. note::
    ``rocm-llvm`` is not a meta-package but a single package that installs the ROCm clang compiler files.

.. list-table::

    * - ``rocm-language-runtime``
      - The ROCm runtime.
    * - ``rocm-developer-tools``
      - Debug and profile HIP applications.
    * - ``rocm-hip-runtime``
      - Run HIP applications writen for the AMD platform.
    * - ``rocm-hip-runtime-devel``
      - Develop applications on HIP or port from CUDA.
    * - ``rocm-opencl-runtime``
      - Run OpenCL-based applications on the AMD platform.
    * - ``rocm-opencl-sdk``
      - Develop OpenCL-based applications for the AMD platform.
    * - ``rocm-hip-libraries``
      - HIP libraries optimized for the AMD platform.
    * - ``rocm-hip-sdk``
      - Develop or port HIP applications and libraries for the AMD platform.
    * - ``rocm-ml-libraries``
      - Key machine learning libraries. Includes MIOpen.
    * - ``rocm-ml-sdk``
      - Develop and run machine learning applications for AMD.
    * - ``rocm-openmp-runtime``
      - Run OpenMP-based applications on the AMD platform.
    * - ``rocm-openmp-sdk``
      - Develop OpenMP-based applications for the AMD platofrm.

Packages in ROCm Programming Models
***********************************

This section discusses the available meta-packages and their packages.
The following image visualizes the meta-packages and their associated packages in a ROCm programming model.

    :alt: Associated packages

- Meta-packages can include another meta-package.
- ``rocm-core`` package is common across all the meta-packages.
- Meta-packages and associated packages are represented in the same color.

.. note::
    The figure above is for informational purposes only, as the individual packages in a meta-package are subject to change.
    Install meta-packages, and not individual packages, to avoid conflicts.
