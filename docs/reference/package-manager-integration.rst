Package manager integration
************************************************************************************

This section provides information about the required meta-packages for the
following AMD ROCm programming models:

* Heterogeneous-Computing Interface for Portability (HIP)
* OpenCL™
* OpenMP™

ROCm package naming conventions
============================================================

A meta-package is a grouping of related packages and dependencies used to
support a specific use case.

**Example:** Running HIP applications

All meta-packages exist in both versioned and non-versioned forms.

* Non-versioned packages: For a single-version installation of the ROCm stack
* Versioned packages: For multi-version installations of the ROCm stack

    :alt: ROCm Release Package Naming

The figure above demonstrates the single and multi-version ROCm packages' naming
structure, including examples for various Linux distributions. See terms below:

*Module* - It is the part of the package that represents the name of the ROCm
component.

**Example:** The examples mentioned in the image represent the ROCm HIP module.

*Module version* - It is the version of the library released in that package. It
should increase with a newer release.

*Release version* - It shows the ROCm release version when the package was
released.

**Example:** `50400` points to the ROCm 5.4.0 release.

*Build id* - It represents the build number for that release.

*Arch* - It shows the architecture for which the package was created.

*Distro* - It describes the distribution for which the package was created. It is
valid only for rpm packages.

**Example:** `el8` represents RHEL 8.x packages.

Components of ROCm programming models
============================================================

The figure below demonstrates the high-level layered architecture of ROCm programming models and their meta-packages.
All meta-packages are a combination of required packages and libraries.

.. note::
    The preceding figure is for informational purposes only. The individual packages in a meta-package
    are subject to change. To avoid conflicts, install meta-packages, not individual packages.

**Example:**

- ``rocm-hip-runtime`` is used to deploy on supported machines to execute HIP
  applications.
- ``rocm-hip-sdk`` contains runtime components to deploy and execute HIP
  applications.

.. note::
    ``rocm-llvm`` is not a meta-package; it's a single package that installs the ROCm Clang compiler files.
